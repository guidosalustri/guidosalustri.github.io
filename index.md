¡Hola! I’m Guido, a game developer with a master’s in Game Design from Uppsala University and a background in Biology and Bioinformatics. I’m Argentinean/Italian and have lived and worked in Argentina, Australia, and Sweden. I focus on mobile games, board games, and hybrid experiences that blend analog and digital play. I am interest in exploreing how these formats can adapt and combine to create new forms of play.

Here I present three games I’ve created. The projects are very distinct from each other and cover a wide range of topics. I selected them because, together, they provide a clear overview of my skills, experience, and versatility. Two out of the three are award-winning games, and in most cases, research has been conducted with, on, or through them. What stands out in all of them is the care, consideration, and dedication invested in each project, a consistent approach that makes me proud to see across all the work I’ve been involved in.

I feel comfortable both designing and programming, and I am self-sufficient enough to handle solo projects. However, I prefer working as part of a team, as I find it more motivating, and collaboration is one of the great appeals of game development for me. My profile offers a unique blend of work experiences, education, and cultural backgrounds. I’ve found this diversity can be a real asset in game development, adding complementary and distict perspectives to games.

  [Essom](https://guidosalustri.github.io/essom/) is an <a href="https://game.speldesign.uu.se/projects/analog-games/essom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">award-winning</a> abstract strategy game for two players. It is a solo project that aesthetically aims to match classical games while keeping gameplay more casual and giving players the opportunity to bluff. The game also explores how metaphors can be embedded in abstract games and how meaning can be conveyed through game mechanics and abstract figures. The original version of the game was crafted in ceramic and wood, and the game is also available in digital format.

- #### String Theory

  [String Theory](https://guidosalustri.github.io/stringtheory/) is an action-puzzle, top-down 2D space game developed by a two-person team using Godot engine. It’s in a prototype stage and both the aesthetics and controls were designed for mobile format. At its core, String Theory explores themes of game flow, player agency and frustration. Moreover, the game has also been employed in <a href="https://uu.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A1965699&dswid=3547" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Visit DiVA">research</a> studying the relationship between players’ motivations and their in-game behaviour.
