  The Last Vampire is an award winning social deduction board game where players must navigate deception, manage scarce blood resources and outwit their foes to survive. It's available in both analog and digital formats, and it's been used as a case study for research both in psychology and game design.

  Essom is an award winning abstract strategy game for two players (1v1). It aims to match aesthetically classical games, yet keeping gameplay somewhat more casual and allowing players to bluff. Although there is a story embedded in its mechanics the game can also be enjoyed by neglecting its meaning all together. The original version of the game is crafted in ceramic and wood and the game is also available in digital format.
