Here I’ve selected three games I’ve created. Together, they provide a clear overview of my skills, experience, and versatility. They are award-winning games and have served as case studies for research, each with that spark a game needs to stand out. They reflect care, consideration, and dedication, qualities I’m proud to see across all my work.

## Projects

- #### The Last Vampire

  [The Last Vampire](https://guidosalustri.github.io/lastvampire/) is an <a href="https://game.speldesign.uu.se/projects/analog-games/the-last-vampire/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">award-winning</a> social deduction board game where players must navigate deception, manage scarce blood resources and outwit their foes to survive. It's available in analog and digital formats, and it's been used as a case study for research both in psychology and game design.

  [Essom](https://guidosalustri.github.io/essom/) is an <a href="https://game.speldesign.uu.se/projects/analog-games/essom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">award-winning</a> abstract strategy game for two players. It is a solo project that aesthetically aims to match classical games while keeping gameplay more casual and giving players the opportunity to bluff. The game also explores how metaphors can be embedded in abstract games and how meaning can be conveyed through game mechanics and abstract figures. The original version of the game was crafted in ceramic and wood, and the game is also available in digital format.

- #### String Theory

  [String Theory](https://guidosalustri.github.io/stringtheory/) is an action-puzzle, top-down 2D space game developed by a two-person team using Godot engine. It’s in a prototype stage and both the aesthetics and controls were designed for mobile format. At its core, String Theory explores themes of game flow, player agency and frustration. Moreover, the game has also been employed in <a href="https://uu.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A1965699&dswid=3547" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Visit DiVA">research</a> studying the relationship between players’ motivations and their in-game behaviour.
