### Experience
---
I feel comfortable both designing and programming, and I am self-sufficient enough to handle solo projects. However, I prefer working as part of a team, as I find it more motivating, and collaboration is one of the great appeals of game development for me. My profile offers a unique blend of work experiences, education, and cultural backgrounds. I’ve found this diversity can be a real asset in game development, adding complementary and distict perspectives to games.
