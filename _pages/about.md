¡Hola! I’m Guido, a game developer with a master’s in Game Design from Uppsala University and a background in Biology and Bioinformatics. I’m Argentinean/Italian and have lived and worked in Argentina, Australia, and Sweden. I focus on mobile games, board games, and hybrid experiences that blend analog and digital play. I am interest in exploreing how these formats can adapt and combine to create new forms of play.

Here I present three games I’ve created. The projects are very distinct from each other and cover a wide range of topics. I selected them because, together, they provide a clear overview of my skills, experience, and versatility. Two out of the three are award-winning games, and in most cases, research has been conducted with, on, or through them. What stands out in all of them is the care, consideration, and dedication invested in each project, a consistent approach that makes me proud to see across all the work I’ve been involved in.

I feel comfortable both designing and programming, and I am self-sufficient enough to handle solo projects. However, I prefer working as part of a team, as I find it more motivating, and collaboration is one of the great appeals of game development for me. My profile offers a unique blend of work experiences, education, and cultural backgrounds. I’ve found this diversity can be a real asset in game development, adding complementary and distict perspectives to games.
