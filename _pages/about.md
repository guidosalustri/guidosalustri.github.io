title: "About Me"
---

¡Hola! I’m Guido, a game developer with a master’s in Game Design from Uppsala University and a background in Biology and Bioinformatics. I’m Argentinean/Italian and have lived and worked in Argentina, Australia, and Sweden. I focus on mobile games, board games, and hybrid experiences that blend analog and digital play, exploring how these formats can combine to create new forms of interaction. I like to think of games not only as entertainment but also as tools for learning, ways to foster social connection, and as a means of artistic expression.

### Education

&nbsp;University of Buenos Aires.

### Experience
---
I completed an <span style="background:#E9DCBE; padding:0px 4px; border-radius:4px;">Erasmus traineeship</span> in 2024-2025, where I collaborated with Ariel Manzur, co-founder of the Godot Engine, and worked as a teaching assistant for courses in game design and game programming.

I also participated in a tutoring programme run by the <span style="background:#E9DCBE; padding:0px 4px; border-radius:4px;">Innovation Center</span> of Uppsala University, where I received guidance on financial sustainability and was granted funding to attend <span style="background:#E9DCBE; padding:0px 4px; border-radius:4px;">Spiel Essen 2025</span> and produce prints of the board games I created. Additionally, I joined several game jams and workshops, such as the <span style="background:#E9DCBE; padding:0px 4px; border-radius:4px;">NASG un-Jam 2024</span> at the University of Skövde, and my games have won awards at conferences and served as the basis for research publications.

Overall, I am comfortable with both game design and programming and have the skills to manage solo projects independently. However, I prefer teamwork, as collaborative environments are one of the aspects I value most in game development. My profile combines diverse work experiences, education, and cultural backgrounds, which I find to be a strong asset for enriching game projects with complementary and unique perspectives.

While this portfolio highlights my work in games, I am always happy to provide additional information about my background in biology and bioinformatics if desired. My experience in the field includes research and lab work, posters, conferences, scholarships, and specialized courses.
