¡Hola! I’m Guido, a game developer with a master’s in Game Design from Uppsala University and a background in Biology and Bioinformatics. I’m Argentinean/Italian and have lived and worked in Argentina, Australia, and Sweden. I focus on mobile games, board games, and hybrid experiences that blend analog and digital play. I am interest in exploreing how these formats can adapt and combine to create new forms of play.

### Education
---
- `Master in Game Design` <code style="float: right; background:black; color:white; padding:2px 6px; border-radius:4px;">2023-2025</code><br>
&nbsp;Uppsala University.
<br>
- `Licentiate in Biological Sciences` <code style="float: right; background:black; color:white; padding:2px 6px; border-radius:4px;">2012-2019</code><br>
&nbsp;University of Buenos Aires.

### Experience
---
I completed an Erasmus traineeship in 2024-2025, where I collaborated with Ariel Manzur, co-founder of the Godot Engine, and worked as a teaching assistant for courses in game design and game programming.

I also participated in a tutoring programme run by the Innovation Center of Uppsala University, where I received guidance on financial sustainability and was granted funding to attend Spiel Essen 2025 and produce prints of the board games I created. Additionally, I joined several game jams and workshops, such as the NASG un-Jam 2024 at the University of Skövde, and my games have won awards at conferences and served as the basis for research publications.

Overall, I am comfortable with both game design and programming and have the skills to manage solo projects independently. However, I prefer teamwork, as collaborative environments are one of the aspects I value most in game development. My profile combines diverse work experiences, education, and cultural backgrounds, which I find to be a strong asset for enriching game projects with complementary and unique perspectives.

While this portfolio highlights my work in games, I am always happy to provide additional information about my background in biology and bioinformatics if desired. My experience in the field includes research and lab work, posters, conferences, scholarships, and specialized courses.

I completed an `Erasmus traineeship` in 2024-2025, where I collaborated with Ariel Manzur, co-founder of the Godot Engine, working as a teaching assistant for courses in game design and game programming using Godot.

I also took part in a `tutoring programme` run by the Uppsala University `Innovation Center`, where I received guidance on financial sustainability, funding opportunities, and stakeholder analysis, as well as funding to attend `Spiel Essen 2025`.

In addition, I participated in several game jams and workshops, such as the `NASG un-Jam 2024` at the `University of Skövde`, and my games have won awards at conferences and served as the basis for research publications.


I am comfortable with both `game design` and `programming` and have the skills to manage solo projects independently. However, I prefer working as a part of a team, as `collaborative environments` are one of the aspects I value most about game dev. My profile brings together `diverse` work experiences, education, and cultural backgrounds, which I have found to be a strong asset in game development, enriching projects with complementary and distinct perspectives.

While this portfolio highlights my work in games, I am always happy to share more about my background in biology and bioinformatics upon request. My experience in this field includes research and lab work, posters, conferences, scholarships, and specialized courses.
