The Last Vampire was the outcome of a group project and the first full-fledged game I ever made. I had the chance to watch a lot of people playing it, and the fact that it‚Äôs always such a fun experience makes me especially proud. I like to think that the fun players can get out of a game relates to how fun the design process was in itself.

For me, games that ‚Äúspark joy‚Äù (as Marie Kondo would say) usually come from playful design experiences. The Last Vampire was exactly that: we unconsciously had a lot of fun when making it, and that reflects in the game.

Funny to think that, without even noticing, we hit on one of game design‚Äôs golden rules; one that is curiously often neglected when developing games nowadays.Of course, I am not implying that just by having fun, a fun game will somehow spawn out of nowhere, but from a design perspective, to me, it feels like it‚Äôs the only possible starting point.

The Last Vampire won [Best Game Design](https://game.speldesign.uu.se/projects/analog-games/the-last-vampire/) at the Gotland Game Conference 2024 and was also nominated for Best in Show. Thanks to this recognition, we received funding that will allow us to take the game to Spiel Essen 2025. Although the game is especially fun in its analog version, a [Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3551316320 "Visit the Steam Workshop") on Tabletop Simulator is also available, showcasing a digital adaptation of the game. Furthermore, it has been used as a case study for research in both psychology and game design by Uppsala University. Publications can be found [here].

From a design perspective, The Last Vampire tackles crucial aspects of social deduction games. A key feature is that the focus is not put on roles, but on items instead. This simple shift not only distributes agency more evenly among players but also allows agency to shift throughout gameplay, something that fixed roles cannot offer.

More importantly, players‚Äô interaction with items, and, as an extension, with blood resources, was specially designed to foster social interaction and give players space to discuss, talk, doubt, deduce, and deceive.

The game features fast and minimal setup, easy-to-remember rules, and lets complexity emerge naturally through twists of arguments, layers of intention, or disguised motives. In the end, it‚Äôs the players themselves who bring the complexity and replayability to the game. It‚Äôs also worth mentioning that no player gets to sit out, since there is no player elimination throughout the game.
