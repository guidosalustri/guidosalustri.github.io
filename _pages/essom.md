The word Essom is the recalling of a word I heard once, which was surely not Essom. I forgot how the word really sounded, how it was spelled, and even from which language it came; just the meaning stayed with me. This un-remembered word was used to name the place where all lost things go, and this is the meaning I give to this new chimera: Essom. I guess the real one, is probably at Essom right now.

In the game, Essom could be the board under the board: that shadow that is cast by board, and where small Sils fall when Tsoas are pushed to holes. Or on a second thought it could also be the area under the Tsoas, where Sils are hidden. Somehow both views are valid. Players search for Sils, but at the same time, they are also the ones that keep them hidden. So when are they really lost? This duality is probably the heart of the heart for Essom.

Essom won [Best Game Design](https://game.speldesign.uu.se/projects/analog-games/essom/) at the Gotland Game Conference 2025. Thanks to this recognition, it received funding to go to Spiel Essen 2025. Although the game is especially fun in its analog version, a [Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3546913194 "Visit the Steam Workshop") on Tabletop Simulator is also available, showcasing a digital adaptation of the game.
