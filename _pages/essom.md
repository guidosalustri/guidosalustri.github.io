At its core, Essom was created as a game that could stand among ancient abstract classics, yet raise its own identity rooted in native Latin American aesthetics and perspective. Crafted from ceramic, wood, and felt balls, the game offers strategic depth but without relying solely on tactical or logical thinking. Since it is not a “perfect information” game, it provides a more intuitive and casual experience, where bluffing can also become part of play.

Essom is a 1v1 game where players need to search and retrieve hidden tokens called Sils. Sils are hidden (by players) under other pieces called Tsoas. A Tsoa with a Sil inside is called a Tsoa-Sil. To retrieve a Sil, a Tsoa-Sil needs to be forced into a cell with a hole.

Essom won <a href="https://game.speldesign.uu.se/projects/analog-games/essom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Best Game Design</a> at the Gotland Game Conference 2025 and received funding to attend Spiel Essen 2025. Although I strongly recommend experiencing the game in its analog form, a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3546913194" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Visit Steam">Steam Workshop</a> on Tabletop Simulator is also available. 

Off the top of my head, I can think of many games and pseudo-games that inspired it: Komikan, Backgammon, Gungi, Tak, Mancala, Xul Chess, and Go, among others.

As a kid, abstract board games have always drawn my attention. I used to think my fascination came from their strategic depth, emergence, minimalism, and low cognitive load. But now I understand it was something else: geometric figures that open infinite paths to tell the same story, over and over again, without using a single word. In the end, this is what nourished Essom, symbolism and meaning stripped of narrative.

The name Essom comes from the recalling of a word I heard once, which was surely not close enough to the word Essom. I forget the language, how it was spelled, and how the word sounded; just its meaning stayed with me. This un-remembered word was used to name the place where all lost things go, and this is the meaning the new chimera, Essom, has. I guess at this point, the real one is probably lost in the real Essom, right next to the necklace my grandma gave me and I lost in the ocean.

For some, the board under the board could be Essom: the shadow cast by the real board, where small Sils fall when Tsoas are pushed into holes. For others, Essom might be the area under the Tsoas, where Sils are hidden. Both views are valid: players search for Sils, but they also keep them hidden. In Essom both sides are experienced at the same time.

The game offers tactical depth, yet it is not a coincidence that memory is such a crucial element of gameplay. Hiding, protecting or searching, in Essom, Sils are the heart of the heart. Remembering or forgetting where Sils are hidden is the starting or ending point for any possible strategy.

Above all, I believe the game represents the search for the identity of a generation that was stolen, where Tsoas and Sils symbolize families. A Tsoa needs to be cornered and pushed; a Sil needs to fall to be reclaimed, an identity must be broken for another to be restored. This is the puzzle Essom presents: beyond winning or losing, players can choose to explore, reflect, and empathise, or instead center in having fun.
